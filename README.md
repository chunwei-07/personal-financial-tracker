## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.8 or higher)
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chunwei-07/personal-financial-tracker.git
    cd personal-financial-tracker
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend (Python):**
    *   Navigate to the `backend` directory.
      ```bash
      cd backend
      ```
    *   Create a Python virtual environment.
      ```bash
      python -m venv .venv
      ```
    *   Activate the virtual environment.
    *   On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\.venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    *   On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```
    *   Install the required Python packages.
      ```bash
      uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
      ```
    *   Navigate back to the root directory.
      ```bash
      cd ..
      ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend (Node.js):**
    *   Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      ```
    *   Install the required npm packages.
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

This application is designed to be run as a single, unified server.

1.  **Build the Frontend:**
    First, you need to create a production build of the frontend assets. From the `/frontend` directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `dist` folder containing the compiled static files.

2.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    Next, start the FastAPI server from the `/backend` directory. The server is configured to serve the frontend you just built.
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

3.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to:
    [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

The application should be fully functional. The first time you run it, the server will automatically create a `financial_tracker.db` file in the project root and seed it with default accounts and categories.

*(For Windows users, a pre-configured `Launch Financial Tracker.bat` script is included in the root directory for convenience. Remember to edit the `PROJECT_PATH` variable inside the script to match your local setup.)*
